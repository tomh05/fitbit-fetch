   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Overview
========

This is a complete python implementation of the Fitbit API.

It uses oAuth for authentication, it supports both us and si
measurements

Quickstart
==========

If you are only retrieving data that doesn't require authorization, then you can use the unauthorized interface::

    import fitbit
    unauth_client = fitbit.Fitbit('<consumer_key>', '<consumer_secret>')
    # certain methods do not require user keys
    unauth_client.food_units()

Here is an example of authorizing with OAuth 1.0::

    # You'll have to gather the user keys on your own, or try
    # ./gather_keys_cli.py <consumer_key> <consumer_secret> for development
    authd_client = fitbit.Fitbit('<consumer_key>', '<consumer_secret>', resource_owner_key='<user_key>', resource_owner_secret='<user_secret>')
    authd_client.sleep()

Here is an example of authorizing with OAuth 2.0::

    # You'll have to gather the tokens on your own, or use
    # ./gather_keys_oauth2.py
    authd_client = fitbit.Fitbit('<consumer_key>', '<consumer_secret>', oauth2=True,
                                 access_token='<access_token>', refresh_token='<refresh_token>')
    authd_client.sleep()

Fitbit API
==========

Some assumptions you should note. Anywhere it says user_id=None,
it assumes the current user_id from the credentials given, and passes
a ``-`` through the API.  Anywhere it says date=None, it should accept
either ``None`` or a ``date`` or ``datetime`` object
(anything with proper strftime will do), or a string formatted
as ``%Y-%m-%d``.
